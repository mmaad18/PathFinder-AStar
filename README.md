# PathFinder-AStar
 
A test run using A*/Djikstra to find the optimal path in the sea from one point to another. This is a real map of Flor√∏ in Norway, where land is represented in white, and sea in black. White pixels are therefore the obstacles

To run it:

1) Download all the files
2) Open AStarMain.py
3) Choose the posistions of start and goal
4) Run AStarMain.py

It should be noted that it will take some time to run as the image is about 1000x600 pixels, so long travel distances is not advised.
